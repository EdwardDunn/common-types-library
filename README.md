**Java Common Types Library**

I have created this library to allow for easy access to common custom types needed in applications. Each type comes with add pre-fix or suffix options and is returned in the correct numerical or symbolic form. The developer can pass the input in any form and the returned value will be formatted correctly. This is a simple library but is useful to have.

A number of JUnit tests is included for each type to allow for easy continous integration testing.
